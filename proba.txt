The app can start with a web scraper that collects data from Otomoto and sends it to a data processing component. The data processing component can clean, transform and structure the data, and then save it to a database. The database can be a MySQL database or any other database that supports the app's requirements.

The app can also include an export component that allows users to export the data from the database to a CSV file as a local file. There can be a corresponding import component that reads the CSV file and imports the data back into the database. The app can also include an analysis component that provides insights into the data, such as visualizations or statistical summaries.

To ensure security, the app can include security features, such as authentication and authorization for accessing the data and functionalities. The app can also encrypt sensitive data and use secure protocols to transmit data.

Finally, the app can have a graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter, which allows users to interact with the app and perform various actions, such as running the scraper, exporting data, or analyzing data. The GUI can have various widgets, such as buttons, menus, and text boxes, that allow users to input or display data.

Overall, this is just one possible diagram for a professional app for scraping, processing, storing, and analyzing data from Otomoto with security features and a tkinter GUI. The actual design may vary depending on the app's requirements and specific use cases.




Mateusz Gruszka
can you split this app into folders and files?
Certainly, here is one possible way to organize the code for the app into folders and files:

lua
Copy code
app/
|-- scraper/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- otomoto_scraper.py
|
|-- database/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- mysql_db.py
|
|-- data_processing/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- data_cleaning.py
|   |-- data_transform.py
|   |-- data_structuring.py
|
|-- export/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- csv_exporter.py
|
|-- import/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- csv_importer.py
|
|-- analysis/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- data_visualization.py
|   |-- statistical_analysis.py
|
|-- gui/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- app_gui.py
|
|-- security/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- auth.py
|   |-- encryption.py
|   |-- secure_protocol.py
|
|-- __init__.py
|-- main.py
|-- config.py
|-- requirements.txt
The app folder contains the main package for the application.
The scraper folder contains the web scraper module otomoto_scraper.py.
The database folder contains the database module mysql_db.py.
The data_processing folder contains modules for cleaning, transforming and structuring data.
The export folder contains the CSV export module csv_exporter.py.
The import folder contains the CSV import module csv_importer.py.
The analysis folder contains modules for data visualization and statistical analysis.
The gui folder contains the tkinter GUI module app_gui.py.
The security folder contains modules for authentication, encryption, and secure protocols.
The __init__.py files are empty files that indicate to Python that a folder should be treated as a package.
The main.py file is the entry point of the application and contains the main function to run the app.
The config.py file contains configuration variables for the app, such as database connection details and security settings.
The requirements.txt file lists the dependencies of the app, which can be installed with pip.
Of course, this is just one possible way to organize the code. The actual structure may depend on the specific needs of the app and the preferences of the developers.
